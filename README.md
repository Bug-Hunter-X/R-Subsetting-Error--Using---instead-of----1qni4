This repository demonstrates a common error in R programming related to subsetting data frames.  The `bug.R` file contains code that incorrectly uses the assignment operator (`=`) instead of the equality operator (`==`) when subsetting a data frame. This results in unintended behavior.  The `bugSolution.R` file provides the corrected code. This is a frequent mistake, particularly for those new to R or coming from languages with less strict type checking.
